A small implementation of a blockchain ledger.

## Description 

A small implementation of a blockchain ledger done with Python3 to understand better the technology. Contains two classes:

* Block, a block of the blockchain with an indexm the data that the block chain carries and the previous bloc hash.
* Blockchain, the ledger 'per se'. It is formed as a python list of Blocks.

This code has the capacity of creating a blockchain as descrived [here](https://unwttng.com/what-is-a-blockchain) [1], and adding blocks with some 'data' or information on them. It can also display the blocks and the state of the blockchain can be saved and loadad from file. 

On the file the block is saved as:

 > @block_index%data_on_the_block$hash_of_previous_block

## Use

1) _Create BlockChain_, this creates an empy blockchain

| blockchain = BlockChain 

2) _Initialize the blockchain_, adds a *Genesis Block* (@0%Genesis Block$0) to the blockchain.

| blockchian.initc()

3) _Create a block_, 

| block = Block(index, data, previous_block_hash)


4) _Add a new block to the blockchain_, creats block (@previous_block_index + 1%data$previosu_block_hash) from the data suplied and adds it to the blockchain.

| blockcain.nextb(data) 

5) _Save the blockchain_

6) _Load a blockchain_

## Warnings:

The data has to be the most basic ascii, as the read() function does not take special characters like Ñ or à. Also @ $ % are reserved characters that marck structure on a block.

## TODO:

* Add saveguards for @ $ %    
* Add blockchain analysis (size,...)    
* Add documentation 
* Cloning capacities
